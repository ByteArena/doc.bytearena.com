Title: Byte Arena

# What is Byte Arena?

Byte Arena is a gaming platform for developers where you have to code the brain of an agent.

## What's an agent?

An agent is a piece of code that is able to communicate with Byte Arena using a simple and well defined API.

An agent perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to reach its objectives.

## How is this even a game?

We find it both stimulating and fun to make things and learn new stuff in the process, while challenging other players doing so; we hope you do too.

## What does it look like?

Once your agent is coded, you can watch it play against other players agents in your browser.

Here's how it looks like.

# [Getting started](guides/getting-started)

While your agent can be coded in whatever programming language you like, this guide will teach you to implement one in JavaScript.

# The beta and its limitations

Byte Arena is not finished yet. We're currently on a beta version of things.

Ultimately, you'll be able to push your agents on [bytearena.com](https://bytearena.com) to compete with other players.

During beta, the online platform will not be available; [however, you can still train, debug and run your agents on your own computer using a simple command line tool we provide](guides/bytearena-cli).
