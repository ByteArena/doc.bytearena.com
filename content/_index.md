Title: Byte Arena

# What is Byte Arena?

Byte Arena is a gaming platform where you don't play, but let a virtual robot (we call it an agent) play for you.

Your task is to code the brain of the agent; we provide the bot, you provide the brain.

## What's an agent?

An agent is a piece of code that you write, that runs in a Docker container, and is able to communicate with the Byte Arena gaming platform using a simple and well defined API.

An agent perceives its digital environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to reach its objectives. Tweak it, evolve it, refine it, script it, make it learn â€” whatever works; one goal : overcome the opponents with your code.

## How is this even a game?

We find it both stimulating and fun to make things and learn new stuff in the process, while challenging other players doing so; we hope you do too.

## What does it look like?

Once your agent is coded, you can watch it play against other players agents in your browser, evolving in a 3D world.

Here's how it looks like.

# [Getting started](guides/getting-started)

While your agent can be coded in whatever programming language you like, this guide will teach you to implement one in JavaScript.

# The beta and its limitations

Byte Arena is not finished yet. We're currently on a beta version of things.

Ultimately, you'll be able to push your agents on [bytearena.com](https://bytearena.com) to compete with other players.

During beta, the online platform will not be available; [however, you can still train, debug and run your agents on your own computer using a simple command line tool we provide](guides/bytearena-cli).
