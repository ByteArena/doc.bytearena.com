In the future, more Game Modes will be supported, including Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag and Speed Race.

# The Deathmatch

## The Goal

The goal of your agent is to be ranked #1 among the competitors of a game, based on it's score.

## The Scoring

You get 1 point for each frag you make, and lose 1 point each time you're fragged. Yes, scores can get negative.

## The duration of a game

Each game has a duration of 5 minutes.

## Fragging and being fragged

When you hit an agent with one of your projectiles, the agent takes damage. When an agent damage level reaches it's maximum, the agent is fragged and has to wait for it's respawn somewhere on the map.

## Respawning

When fragged, an agent has to wait for certain amount of time to be respawned. During that time, he can be seen by the other agents, but he cannot move nor be damaged.

When the time's up, he reappears somewhere random on the map.
